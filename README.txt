# Spanish ADR corpus and SpanishDrugEffectBD database

SpanishADR is the first corpus of Spanish user comments extracted from social media annotated with drugs and adverse events. User comments were collected from the www.forumclinic.org website. The annotation was carried out using the GATE tool. 

In addition, we have automatically built the first database, SpanishDrugEffectBD, with information about drugs, their drug indications as well as their adverse drug reactions in Spanish.
